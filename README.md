# Breakout Game
Classic game from the 80s

Implemented using Turtle module in Python. Purpose is to hit all of the bricks with the ball and not let the ball hit bottom wall.

## Getting started
To get started all you need to do is to download all the files from this directory and run main.py. Play around and see if you enjoy the gameplay.

## Issues
Feel free to roast this work ;) I will adjust it to your needs.
